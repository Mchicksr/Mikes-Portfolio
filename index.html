      <h3>About Mike</h3>
      <p>I love web development because it allows me to express my creativity in the cyber tech world! I enjoy the challenges associated with web development. There is no better feeling than debugging or having an idea and finding a way to translate it into something that myself and other users can enjoy.. Coming from a background of music I know one of the most important processes to know is branding. Having the ability to create a site from scratch and allowing it to have all the functions I can imagine is something I deem as essential. An additional reason I am excited about learning coding, is that I am an avid gamer, and it would be amazing to help develop video games one day! I look forward to working with other developers and having a part in creating applications and eventually software that can impact the world in a positive way. Outside of coding, I enjoy many different activities. As stated before,I am a DJ as well as a sound engineer. During my time off (and when Iâ€™m not in quarantine) I like to go hiking and just enjoy spending time with my family! </p>
      <p>I am happy to join Thinkful So that I can become fluent and a more efficent software developer!</p>
